        <h2> ABOUT  TREE 
</h2>
        <p>“A tree is the best friend of man on earth.” When we use trees respectfully and economically, we have one of the greatest resources on earth. Trees are rightfully called the ‘lungs of the earth.’ Life on earth would cease to exist in the absence of trees. Trees are responsible for sustaining the environment in several ways.

            Trees release life-supporting oxygen and absorb harmful gases like carbon dioxide during the process of photosynthesis. They act as sponges by taking in toxic emissions and other pollutants, released into the atmosphere by industries and vehicles. The roots of trees bind the soil together thereby preventing erosion. The blatant and increased rate of deforestation is the primary cause of landslides. In addition to being the bearers of delicious fruits, trees are the natural habitat of several species of animals, birds, and insects. Thus, the destruction of a tree implies the destruction of an entire ecosystem.
            
            We have inherited this planet with its many resources, from our ancestors. The onus rests on us to protect the earth’s fragile ecosystem, so that future generations have a place they can call home. It is indeed ironic that despite being at the top of the food chain Homo Sapiens are intent on destroying the very things that guarantee their survival. However, there is a silver lining. The situation can be remedied by restoring the earth’s green cover and taking concrete measures to reduce carbon emissions. Let’s all take a vow to go green and save the earth from destruction.
            
            The Important Role of Trees in the Environment – 200 Words Essay on Tree Plantation
            
            Trees are the most benevolent givers in nature. They play an extremely important role in giving life and sustaining it, as a whole, as well as maintaining a balance in the eco-system. This makes it crucial for us to understand how significant trees are to our life on earth and what we can do to counter the problem of their depleting numbers and all the additional challenges that come with it.
            
            Trees play an extremely important part in regulating the temperature and making the weather conditions conducive to rainfall. They take in carbon dioxide from the air, thereby purifying it, and release oxygen, which is essential to the sustenance of life. Moreover, they also provide us with wood, food, fuel, paper, etc, which are an important part of our daily lives. Furthermore, they are home to all kinds of animals and birds as well.
            
            Deforestation is a major reason behind the climate change crisis that we are facing today. Not only has it led to the occurrence of numerous natural calamities, but it has also resulted in the severe depletion and extinction of many species of flora and fauna.
            
            It is high time that we took the responsibility for our actions. We need to give back to the earth and take care of her the same way she has been taking care of us for so long. We need to plant as many trees as possible to make our earth beautiful and green again.
            
            Why Tree Plantation is Important – 500 Words Essay on Tree Plantation
            
            “Plant a tree today for a better tomorrow.” The significance of forest cover and tree plantation cannot be stressed upon enough, and their importance has only increased in the present scenario, with global warming and climate change being very real threats to our planet and all its inhabitants.
            
            Tree plantation refers to the transplantation of saplings or sowing of seeds in order to facilitate green cover and promote afforestation. Tree plantation can be a very fulfilling and fruitful activity! Not only is it good for the environment and the earth, but it is also a way in which you can help in making the world a better and cleaner place to live in, as trees help to bring down the levels of pollution.
            
            The advantages of planting trees are manifold, such as:
            
            1. Trees are Home to All Manner of Flora and Fauna
            
            The earth is home to not just us but trees as well, and trees, in turn, are home to a variety of birds and animals such as monkeys, koalas, owls, tree frogs, pythons, etc. So, by erasing trees from the face of the earth and destroying green cover, we are destroying the homes of all these creatures as well. Moreover, trees also provide these creatures with food in the form of leaves and fruits, which is even more reason to preserve them.
            
            Cutting these trees is results in the destruction of the natural habitat of these animals, leading to consequences as dire and disastrous as the diminishing of their populations or in the worst-case scenario, even the extinction of all these beautiful creatures. This is why it is imperative that we plant trees to maintain the ecological balance and ensure harmony in our biodiversity.
            
            2. Growth of Forest Cover Leads to Growth in Economy
            
            Trees are an indispensable part of our lives because they provide us with so many things that are essential for us. Everything, right from rubber, wood and paper to fruits and vegetables is provided to us by trees. Without trees, we would not have houses and other buildings, paper to write on, or even food. All these products that we obtain from trees are bought and sold and play a major role in the domestic as well as the international economy. Therefore, it is important to note that promoting afforestation will promote and boost the economy as well.
            
            3. Planting trees can Help Combat the Negative Impact of Deforestation
            
            All relationships are about giving and taking, even our relationship with the earth. It is only fair that we plant more trees to make up for the ones we cut, so as to maintain the ecological balance and natural harmony. Planting trees is the only way to make sure that our planet’s green cover is not wiped out completely.
            
            Trees give us life. It is time that we gave back to nature. It is time that we nurture the earth now and tree plantation would be a great leap forward in this endeavor.
            
            The Significance of Tree Plantation – 500 Words Essay on Tree Plantation
            
            Trees are the embodiment of life itself. Not only do they give life, but they also sustain it as well by proving us and all other living creatures with two things that are essential for the sustenance of life, which are oxygen and food. Moreover, they also provide shelter and food to birds and animals and give us wood, paper, etc., that are an integral part of our daily lives.
            
            What’s more? Did you know that trees also work as air-purifiers? They play the role of filters in our ecosystem by absorbing harmful gases from the air and bringing down the levels of pollution. In addition to all this, they help in maintaining the balance in our ecological system and make conditions conducive to rainfall, thereby ensuring that life flourishes. They take in the carbon dioxide present in the air, thereby regulating the temperature and making it cooler and more pleasant.
            
            Unfortunately, however, despite the fact that trees are probably the most benign beings on the planet and do nothing but give of themselves to everyone and everything around them, we have shown them no mercy. Deforestation is a huge environmental concern now, and a big reason behind the climate change crisis we are facing today. However, with environmental activists passionately fighting for the cause, awareness about the negative impact of deforestation has increased. That being said, it is only fair that we give back to the earth now by planting trees to right the wrongs committed by us. It is the only way to restore the earth to her earlier green glory and save ourselves from any natural disasters in the future.
            
            Now, this is not to say that people haven’t made attempts to right their wrongs in the past. In fact, the Chipko Movement was a great example of people coming together to save trees and encourage people to plant trees, and by extension save the earth. With the rising awareness about the importance of planting trees and the positive impact it will have on the environment, the Govt. has taken the initiative and issued funds and equipment for tree plantation, while also carrying out projects to plant trees in areas that are devoid of green cover.
            
            In conclusion, it would not be wrong to say that the reason we are facing the climate change problem today is that we could not and did not realize the value of trees and appreciate them for everything they do, yesterday. But it is never too late to make amends. We can make things better by planting more trees and facilitating afforestation. We have done nothing but take from nature for so long. It is high time we gave back to the earth and there is no time like the present to do a good deed and make the earth a clean, green, and beautiful place to live in once again. After all, the future generations must inherit the earth in the same condition it was left to us, if not better. We owe it to them to make the world a healthy, happy, and safe place to live in.
            
            The Importance of Planting Trees – 1000 Words Essay on Tree Plantation
            
            The importance of promoting tree plantation cannot be stressed enough. It has been aptly stated that “People who will not sustain trees will soon live in a world that will not sustain people”. A world without trees is akin to a barren desert with no life. All forms of life on earth are interdependent and one cannot hope to exist without the other. Preservation of all-natural resources is imperative for the balance of our ecosystem. Hence the need to promote tree plantation on a war footing.
            
            Trees benefit us in numerous ways. They absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen during the process of photosynthesis. This helps in combating climate change. Studies have shown that an acre of trees can absorb the same amount of carbon dioxide produced by a car that has been driven for twenty-six thousand miles. Strong healthy trees act as carbon sinks, absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide and reducing the effects of climate change. Also, in a year an acre of mature trees can provide oxygen for eighteen people. By absorbing pollutants like sulfur dioxide, ammonia, and nitrogen oxide, trees play a huge part in purifying the air. Tree canopies act as physical filters by trapping dust and absorbing pollutants from the air.
            
            Trees help cool the environment, thereby conserving energy by reducing the need for air conditioning. Streets and cities with a larger green cover are significantly cooler as compared to those without. Ultraviolet rays are known to be the leading cause of skin cancer. Trees shield against UV rays by 50%.
            
            Trees play an important part in conserving water. The shade from trees slows down the rate of water evaporation from lawns, gardens, etc. Trees also help in preventing water pollution. They reduce runoff by breaking rainfall, thus allowing water to flow into the earth. They act like sponges that filter rainwater and recharge the groundwater table. Moreover, trees play an important part in the water cycle and control the moisture level of the ecosystem. Tree plantation has a major role to play in preventing soil erosion. The roots of trees bind the soil, thus preventing it from getting washed away during rains.
            
            Trees are a source of food and wood, both of which help promote the economy of the region. The forest industry provides ample job opportunities. Additionally, sustainable tree farming provides timber to build homes and wood for cooking and heating. Trees are also a habitat and sanctuary for many species of birds, animals, and insects. When young, they provide shelter to birds, insects, lichen, and fungi. The trunks of ancient trees can host owls, bats, and beetles, to name a few tree-dwelling species. Thus, trees are unique hosts of complex microhabitats.
            
            The power to heal is inherent in nature. Research has shown that exposure to nature improves concentration and reduces mental fatigue. Children diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder have been found to show improvement when they have access to nature. Studies have also shown that within minutes of being surrounded by trees and green spaces, BP drops, heart rate slows and stress levels reduce.
            
            Unfortunately, in our bid to modernize and progress we have been systematically destroying forests and depleting the earth’s resources. The history of deforestation dates back centuries. During earlier times, it was balanced through a natural growth process as tree cutting was done for personal or community use only. But with the expansion of agriculture, forest lands started being cleared. Destruction increased after the industrial revolution and the urbanization and commercial exploitation that began during the colonial period was the main cause of deforestation. The consequences of all that mindless destruction are now there, for all to see- global warming, erratic weather patterns, increase in the frequency and volume of, floods, melting of glaciers, desertification of once fertile area, loss of soil productivity, extinction of several species, imbalance in the ecosystem and nonavailability of forest products. Franklin D.Roosevelt very rightly said, “A nation that destroys its soils destroys itself. Forests are the lungs of our land, purifying the air and giving fresh strength to our people”. It is essential to remember this truth if we are to prevent more species including ourselves from becoming extinct.
            
            Many countries across the world are beginning to realize the importance of afforestation. Several local bodies, private citizens and non-governmental organizations are working tirelessly to mitigate the damage inflicted over the years. In India, tree planting is usually carried out during the monsoons, which is from June to September. Van Mahotsav or Tree Plantation Day is celebrated during the first week of July every year. There are a number of steps that can be taken to conserve forests. Cutting down of trees can be regulated using methods like clear-cutting, selective cutting, and shelter cutting. Large scale commercial deforestation should be avoided. Forest fires can destroy large tracts of green cover. Measures should be taken to avoid forest fires. These include making fire lanes, clearing dry leaves and trees, and spreading chemicals to control fires. Also, better farming practices can be adopted. It is necessary to avoid slash and burn farming, overgrazing by cattle, and shifting agriculture. The concept of national parks and game sanctuaries have become popular over the past years. This method of developing forests as tourist centers can not only protect forests but also earn foreign exchange. Several countries have developed their forests as tourist centers.
            
            Before embarking on a plantation drive it is important to keep a few things in mind. The type of trees to be planted depends on the topography and climate of the area. It is preferable to plant indigenous species as they are better suited to the local habitat. Also, this helps preserve traditional flora.
            
            This is the ideal time when people must realise the significance of plantation and contribute to it. The government must take this issue seriously and more and more individuals must work to pursue this essential objective.
